If the goal is to maximize the annual revenue, the LP is: 

Max = 7000*L+12000*M+20000*U+5000*P+15000*R-10000*S-7000*C;
[Land] .05*L + .07*M + .03*U + .025*P + .045*S + .1*R < .85*50 + .85*(.25*C);
[Retail] .023*L + .034*M + .046*U + .023*P + .034*S â€“ R >0;
[Classrooms] 1.3*L + 1.2*M +.5*U + 1.4*P -25*S < 0;
L>100;
M>125;
U>75;
P>300;
L<200;
M<190;
U<260;
P<600;
R<25;
S<2/.045;

Where: 
  L = # of Low income units built 
  M = # of Medium income units built 
  U = # of Upper income units built 
  P = # of Public housing units built 
  R = # of Retail units 
  S = # of School classrooms  
  C = # of Condemned units purchased for the development 
//(Note that this model allows for factional numbers of each type of unit, including classrooms.)
